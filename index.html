                 ### A Small Funny Story

One sunny afternoon, three friends ‚Äì Tom, Jerry, and Spike ‚Äì decided to go on a fishing trip. They packed their gear and headed to the nearby lake. Tom, known for his clumsiness, accidentally tripped over a rock and fell into the water. Jerry and Spike burst into laughter as they helped him out, drenched and grumbling.

Determined to catch the biggest fish, Tom cast his line with great enthusiasm. After a few minutes, he felt a strong tug on his fishing rod. "I got one!" he exclaimed. But as he reeled it in, to everyone's surprise, it wasn‚Äôt a fish but an old boot.

Not willing to give up, Tom tried again. This time, he managed to hook a giant fish. Excited, he struggled to pull it in, but the fish was too strong and pulled him into the water once more. Jerry and Spike laughed even harder, and Tom couldn‚Äôt help but join in.
